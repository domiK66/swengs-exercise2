Implement a simple Stack class in an extra python file. (Do not forget to import the stack class at the beginning of this file)

The stack class should support following methods:

Stack.push(my_var) -> None
Stack.pop() -> Returns last element from stack (if the stack is empty, a ValueError should be raised)
Stack.size() -> Returns the number of elements on the stack.
Stack.__str__() -> Returns a string representation of the stack "<Stack with 1 object(s)>" (depending on number of items)

Implement a NegativeNumberStack class that only accepts negative numbers
