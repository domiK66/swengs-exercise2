# Implement a simple Stack class in an extra python file. 
Do not forget to import the stack class at the beginning of this file

Implement a NegativeNumberStack class that only accepts negative numbers

Implement a PositiveNumberStack class that only accepts positive numbers

The stack classes should support following methods:

- Stack.push(my_var) -> None

- Stack.pop() -> Returns last element from stack (if the stack is empty, a ValueError should be raised)

- Stack.size() -> Returns the number of elements on the stack.

- Stack.__str__() -> Returns a string representation of the stack "<Stack with 1 object(s)>" (depending on number of items)
